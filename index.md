The goal is to create a “developer” environment on your machine. We'll later be copying and pasting code (mostly Python) from chatbots onto our local development environment!

If you run into trouble, don’t hesitate to shoot me a WhatsApp for quick trouble shooting or even a call

Please take your time. But it should not take more than 5-10min :)
